# Gb-Baas: Investor Deck Outline

---

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**

*   **Title:** Gb-Baas: The Future of Software Monetization
*   **Subtitle:** A headless, developer-first Backend-as-a-Service for licensing, payments, and user management.
*   **Your Name/Company Name & Logo**

### **Slide 2: The Problem**

*   **Headline:** Software Monetization is Broken for Modern Developers.
*   **Key Point 1:** **High Friction:** Implementing licensing and payments is complex, time-consuming, and distracts developers from their core product.
*   **Key Point 2:** **The "Stripe Tax":** Existing solutions are expensive, taking a significant percentage of every transaction, which hurts indie developers and startups the most.
*   **Key Point 3:** **Global Payment Gaps:** Traditional payment models (credit card-heavy) don't work well in massive, mobile-first markets like India, where UPI is king.
*   **Visual:** Icons representing complexity, high fees, and a map highlighting the underserved markets.

### **Slide 3: The Solution**

*   **Headline:** Gb-Baas: One API for Licenses, Payments, and Growth.
*   **Core Concept:** We provide a simple, headless backend that handles the entire user lifecycle, from a seamless one-click trial to a paid subscription, using the payment methods developers and users already have.
*   **Three Pillars:**
    1.  **Frictionless Onboarding:** One-click, self-service trials via social logins.
    2.  **Flexible Monetization:** Support for manual licenses, coupons, and a revolutionary "Bring Your Own Gateway" model for UPI/QR code payments.
    3.  **Actionable Analytics:** A simple dashboard to manage users and understand business growth.
*   **Visual:** A clean diagram showing an app, our BAAS in the middle, and icons for Google, UPI, and a license key on the other side.

### **Slide 4: How It Works**

*   **Headline:** So Simple, It Feels Like Magic.
*   **Step 1 (Admin):** "Define Your Plans" - Show a screenshot of our clean admin dashboard where the admin sets up a trial or a paid plan.
*   **Step 2 (End-User):** "One-Click Trial" - Show a screenshot of an app with a "Sign in with Google" button.
*   **Step 3 (Developer):** "Activate with UPI" - Show a screenshot of an app displaying a QR code, with a caption: "Our BAAS listens for the payment confirmation and automatically issues the license."
*   **Tagline:** We handle the plumbing, so developers can focus on building.

### **Slide 5: Market Size & Opportunity**

*   **Headline:** A Massive, Underserved Market.
*   **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** The global market for developer tools and services ($XX Billion).
*   **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** The segment of indie developers, startups, and SMEs building software ($X Billion).
*   **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** Our initial target - developers in UPI-dominant markets (India, Southeast Asia) and those frustrated with high-commission platforms. (Show growth statistics for UPI transactions).
*   **Visual:** Charts and graphs showing market growth and UPI adoption.

### **Slide 6: Business Model**

*   **Headline:** Simple, Transparent, and Scalable Pricing.
*   **Core Model:** A SaaS subscription model based on the number of active licenses managed by the BAAS.
*   **Pricing Tiers:**
    *   **Hobbyist (Free):** Up to 50 active licenses. Includes all core features.
    *   **Startup ($X/month):** Up to 1,000 active licenses.
    *   **Growth ($XX/month):** Up to 10,000 active licenses.
    *   **Enterprise (Custom):** For large-scale needs.
*   **Key Differentiator:** We are **NOT** taking a percentage of the transaction. We are a flat-fee SaaS. This is our "unfair advantage" over Stripe for this use case.

---

### **Slide 7: Go-To-Market Strategy**

*   **Headline:** Winning the Hearts of Developers.
*   **Phase 1 (Bottom-Up):** Target indie developers and startups on platforms like GitHub, Indie Hackers, and developer forums. Offer a generous free tier to drive adoption.
*   **Phase 2 (Content & Community):** Create high-quality tutorials, blog posts, and documentation. Build a community around making software monetization easier.
*   **Phase 3 (Partnerships):** Integrate with app marketplaces and developer tool ecosystems.

*   **Headline:** Built by Developers, for Developers.
*   **Your Picture & Bio:** Highlight your experience in software development, product management, and understanding the target market.

### **Slide 9: Financial Projections (Optional, for later stages)**

*   **Headline:** A Clear Path to Profitability.
*   **Chart:** A simple 3-year projection showing growth in active licenses, revenue, and key milestones.
*   **Key Assumptions:** List the core assumptions driving the model (e.g., conversion rate from free to paid, average number of licenses per customer).
